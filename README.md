# Poem Summarization using encoder-decoder architechture 

This project demonstrates the use of  T5 (Text-to- Text Transfer Transformer) model for summarizing
poetry, a challenging domain due to the intricate language, abstract themes, and emotional depth found in poetic texts. Traditional text summarization models struggle with
poetry, as it often involves complex structures, figurative
language, and condensed meanings that require more than
simple extraction of key sentences. By employing the T5
model, which excels in various natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, the study aims to create concise
yet meaningful summaries of poems. The results show
that T5 successfully maintains the sentiment and thematic
integrity of the poems, demonstrating its potential in
literary text summarization.
